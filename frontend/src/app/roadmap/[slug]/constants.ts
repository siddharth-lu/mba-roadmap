    description:
      'Your MBA journey begins with core management fundamentals: quantitative methods, economics, organizational behavior, and business communication. At ITM, the first semester includes an induction program, foundation courses, and soft-skills training—setting you up for the specialization choices ahead. Mumbai’s ecosystem gives you early exposure to live case discussions and industry speakers that many tier-2 city colleges lack.',

    title: 'Phase 2',
    subtitle: 'Core curriculum & specialization core',
    description:
      'You dive into finance, marketing, operations, and strategy alongside your chosen specialization core. ITM’s curriculum is designed with industry input, so you learn tools and frameworks that employers actually use. Capstone Phase 1, NGO internship, and outbound programs add real-world texture. Compared to traditional programs that rely on textbooks, this phase blends theory with case studies, simulations, and industrial visits.',

    title: 'Phase 3',
    subtitle: 'Industry-integrated internship',
    description:
      'A 5-month industry internship—plus 2 weeks of NGO internship—puts you ahead of typical 2–3 month stints. You build credibility in your specialization and often convert internships into pre-placement offers. Mumbai’s concentration of corporates, startups, and BFSI firms means more quality roles and better mentorship. Many students use this period to network and narrow down their target roles.',

    title: 'Phase 4',
    subtitle: 'Advanced specialization & placement readiness',
    description:
      'Advanced subjects, Capstone Phase 2, and intense placement preparation (300+ hours of soft skills and interview prep at ITM) sharpen you for recruitment. With a small batch of 60 and 1-1 mentorship, monthly CEO talks, and strong industry connect, you’re not just another resume. The 35+ professional certifications included in the program give you concrete proof of skills that recruiters look for.',

    title: 'Phase 5',
    subtitle: 'Placement & your outcome',
    description:
      "ITM's 100% placement record reflects both Mumbai's job market and the program's focus on employability. You'll assimilate your learning through research and work experience, complete the Final Capstone, and step into roles in your specialization. Whether you're targeting high package placement, a career switch, or entrepreneurship, the combination of location, curriculum, and industry connect positions you for the outcome you want.",
